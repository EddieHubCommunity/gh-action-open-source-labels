## Label standards

> To facilitate the community in finding ways to contribute that match their experiences and skillsets, we have developed a comprehensive system for labelling issues and PRs. This is an introduction to this standard labelling scheme.

> Labels consist of three fields, viz. name, description and color. Label names should have a consistent format to aid both filtering within the github UI as well as scanning visually through the list. The following format is the most suited to this task (where ⎵ denotes a single space):

```
<emoji>⎵<category>:⎵<name>
```

Using the label convention from https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/repo-labels/

## How to update the labels

To add a new label, update the `labels.json` file and the GitHub Action will do the rest.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "good first issue",
        "color": "7f0799"
    },
    {
        "name": "💬 talk: discussion",
        "color": "f9bbe5"
    } 
]
```

> This example shows two common ways to add a label. One without emoji and the other with emoji. Preferred way is the one with emoji at the beginning but there are also some labels which are commonly used without emojis.
