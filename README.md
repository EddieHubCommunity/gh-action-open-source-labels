## Label standards

> To facilitate the community in finding ways to contribute that match their experiences and skillsets, we have developed a comprehensive system for labelling issues and PRs. This is an introduction to this standard labelling scheme.

> Labels consist of three fields, viz. name, description and color. Label names should have a consistent format to aid both filtering within the github UI as well as scanning visually through the list. The following format is the most suited to this task (where ‚éµ denotes a single space):

```
<emoji>‚éµ<category>:‚éµ<name>
```

Using the label convention from https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/repo-labels/

## How to update the labels

To add a new label, update the `labels.json` file and the GitHub Action will do the rest.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "good first issue",
        "color": "7f0799"
    },
    {
        "name": "üí¨ talk: discussion",
        "color": "f9bbe5"
    } 
]
```

> This example shows two common ways to add a label. One without emoji and the other with emoji. Preferred way is the one with emoji at the beginning but there are also some labels which are commonly used without emojis.
